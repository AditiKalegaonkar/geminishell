**Project Title:** Gesture-Based PPT Control and Classroom Automation using MediaPipe and ESP32

**Project Description:**

**Objective:**
This project aims to develop a system that enables users to control PowerPoint presentations and various classroom functions using hand gestures. The system will utilize the MediaPipe library to detect gestures, an ESP32 microcontroller with a camera module, and Wi-Fi connectivity.

**Methodology:**

1. **Gesture Detection and Recognition:**
   - Utilize the MediaPipe library in Python to detect hand landmarks and gestures in real-time from a camera feed.
   - Implement algorithms to classify gestures such as swiping, pointing, and specific hand shapes.

2. **ESP32 Integration:**
   - Connect an ESP32 microcontroller with a camera module to capture video footage.
   - Configure the ESP32 to communicate with the Python script via Wi-Fi.

3. **PPT Control and Classroom Functions:**
   - Develop a software module that receives gesture commands from the Python script.
   - Implement functionality to control PowerPoint slides, navigate menus, and perform actions like muting or unmuting microphones.

4. **Web Server Interface:**
   - Create a web interface to provide users with an intuitive interface for controlling the system.
   - Allow users to select the gestures they want to use for specific actions.

5. **Mobile App Integration:**
   - Develop an Android or iOS app that allows users to control the system from their mobile devices.

**Project Deliverables:**

- A complete system that enables gesture-based control of PowerPoint presentations and classroom functions.
- A user-friendly web interface and a mobile app for controlling the system.
- Thorough documentation, including a user manual and technical specifications.

**Significance and Impact:**

This project provides a novel method for controlling presentations and classroom activities using hand gestures, enhancing the user experience and making classroom interactions more engaging and dynamic. It has applications in education, corporate meetings, and various other settings.
